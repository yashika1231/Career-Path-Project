## Core Features

This platform is built as a complete, end-to-end solution for job seekers.

### 1. AI-Powered Resume Builder

- **7-Section Form:** A comprehensive builder for Personal Info, Summary, Skills, Work Experience, Projects, Education, and Certifications.
- **Real-Time Live Preview:** A "sticky" A4-sized preview that updates instantly as you type.
- **Balanced Two-Column Layout:** A modern, professional resume layout that intelligently balances content.
- **Persistent Storage:** All resume data is automatically saved to your Neon (Postgres) database.

### 2. JD-to-Resume Analyzer

- **Paste Any Job Description:** A dedicated page to analyze your saved resume against any job description from any source.
- **Powered by Groq & Llama 3:** Uses the Groq API for high-speed analysis, structured as a JSON response.
- **Actionable Feedback:** Returns a detailed report including a **Match Score (%)**, **Overall Fit Summary**, **Key Strengths**, **Areas for Improvement**, and **Missing Keywords**.

### 3. Smart Job Portal

- **Real-World Job Data:** Fetches live job postings from the JSearch API.
- **Advanced Filtering:** Includes filters for query, location, date posted, remote work, and employment type (Full-time, Intern, etc.).
- **"Match My Resume" Button:** The app's "killer feature." With one click, you can run your saved resume against any job in the search results, instantly showing you a full analysis in a modal.

### 4. AI Career Bot

- **Conversational AI:** A beautiful, ChatGPT-style chat interface (built with Aceternity UI) for career advice.
- **Custom Persona:** Uses a Groq API-call with a custom "system prompt" to act as a professional career coach.
- **Persistent Chat History:** All conversations are saved to and retrieved from the Neon database.

### 5. Dynamic User Dashboard

- **Modern "Bento Box" Layout:** A clean, engaging dashboard that serves as the app's command center.
- **Real, Personalized Data:** The dashboard is a Server Component that fetches:
  - Your **AI Resume Tip of the Day** (generated by Groq).
  - Your **Recent Chat History**.
  - A **Cached Job Feed** of recommended jobs (this smart caching saves API calls).

### 6. Full-Stack Authentication

- **Clerk Auth:** Secure authentication with dedicated, custom-styled `/sign-in` and `/sign-up` pages.
- **Protected Routes:** A custom `middleware.ts` file protects all app routes and correctly handles redirects for logged-in and logged-out users.
- **Automatic User Sync:** Automatically syncs new Clerk users into the Neon `User` database table.
